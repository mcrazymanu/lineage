**Changes:**
- there aren't any changes, this build was rolled out to test the Updater app. If it doesn't work on the previous one, then it should work on this one now!

## 2022-06-26

**Changes:**
- initial release builds, only bug is auto brightness (to be more specific, the virtual camera light sensor, we haven't found a fix yet.)

**Notes:**
- Currently, only M127F is supported (perhaps F127F too? Please try and report). For M127G users, there will be specific builds in the future! For the other 850 devices, there will be builds as well in future if there are any testers!
- SELinux is enforcing, data partition is FBE encrypted.
- If you are on a test build from 23.04.2022 or newer, you should be able to update to this build without issues, but I'd still recommend to clean flash!
- For bug reports, see #bugs and #logs in the support chat!
